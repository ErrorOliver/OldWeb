# OldWeb
Welcome! This is the OldWeb website where we are back in the early 2000's! Let's get rock and rollin'!

## Introduction

OldWeb is a nostalgic project that aims to recreate the look and feel of websites from the early 2000s. Remember those days when websites were filled with animated GIFs, bright colors, and funky fonts? This project takes you back in time to experience the internet as it was in its early days.

## Features

- Retro Design: OldWeb brings back the retro design aesthetics of the early 2000s, with vibrant colors, animated GIFs, and pixelated graphics.

- Simple and Lightweight: The website is designed to be lightweight, focusing on simplicity and minimalism, just like websites used to be back then.

- Time Travel: Immerse yourself in the early days of the internet and relive the nostalgia of browsing websites from the past.
